            <h2>Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web was born from <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em>'s idea at CERN to develop a single information system that would create a platform for document sharing among professors, students and all academics.</p>

            <p>In 1989, while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), Berners-Lee proposed a global hypertext project that would eventually become the World Wide Web. His vision was to create a system where physicists could share information across different computer systems.</p>
            
            <h3>The First Web Browser</h3>
            <p>In 1990, Berners-Lee developed the first web browser-editor called WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus) and the first web server. This allowed researchers to view and edit hypertext documents, creating the foundation for the web as we know it today.</p>

            <h2>HTML Development</h2>
            <p><em>HTML</em>, a basic markup language based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), was first presented by <em>Berners-Lee</em> in 1991. With only 18 elements, this early iteration of <em>HTML</em> was mostly concerned with document structure, including heading, paragraph, and simple linking tags.</p>

            <h2>HTTP and Web Communication</h2>
            <p><em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> (HTTP) serves as the main primary protocol for web communication, allowing for communication between servers and browsers by sending get requests and receiving HTML text of the required page. The presentational and structural guidelines that browsers use to render web pages are provided by this HTML content.</p>
            
            <h3>How HTTP Works</h3>
            <ol class="process-list">
                <li>A user enters a URL in their browser or clicks a link</li>
                <li>The browser sends an HTTP request to the server</li>
                <li>The server processes the request and retrieves the necessary files</li>
                <li>The server sends an HTTP response containing the requested HTML</li>
                <li>The browser renders the HTML content into a visual web page</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This client-server model became the foundation of web communication and remains the basis of how we interact with web content today.</p>
